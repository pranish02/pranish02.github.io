          Barca deny neymar return speculation
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Barcelona board can be justifiably perplexed as to why some of their players are openly discussing a potential return for Neymar, and board spokesperson Josep Vives has stated that no such offer is on the table.Reportedly unhappy at Paris Saint-Germain,
          the winger has been spoken of in glowing terms by both Ivan Rakitic and Philippe Coutinho in recent days."We are not aware of Neymar wanting to return to Barcelona," commented Vives on Monday night."The Brazilian was a player who left the club
          and we wished him luck at the time of his departure."Since then, nothing else has happened."We aren't going to enter into a hypothetical debate about what someone says about a player that isn't one of our own."

        <h1>After China and the G League, a Confident Brandon Jennings Is Back in the NBA</h1>
        <p>
          When Brandon Jennings suits up for the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday, it will have been almost a year since he stepped on the floor in an NBA uniform. The basketball world was intrigued when news broke in February that Jennings had signed with the Wisconsin
          Herd, the Bucks' G League affiliate. He was claimed off waivers after a brief stint in China.
