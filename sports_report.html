            <h2>  Barca deny neymar return speculation</h2>
            <p>The Barcelona board can be justifiably perplexed as to why some of their players are openly discussing a potential return for Neymar, and board spokesperson Josep Vives has stated that no such offer is on the table. Reportedly unhappy at Paris Saint-Germain, the winger has been spoken of in glowing terms by both Ivan Rakitic and Philippe Coutinho in recent days."We are not aware of Neymar wanting to return to Barcelona," commented Vives on Monday night."The Brazilian was a player who left the club  and we wished him luck at the time of his departure."Since then, nothing else has happened."We aren't going to enter into a hypothetical debate about what someone says about a player that isn't one of our own."</p>

            <h2>Mohamed Salah Encouraged to Shave 'Terrorist' Beard by Egyptian Journalist</h2>
            <p>An Egyptian writer has called on Liverpool sensation Mohamed Salah to shave his beard because it "puts him in one basket with extremists.... and terrorists." Salah Montaser made the recommendation in state-run Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram (h/t Associated Press) on Sunday, and his comments drew fierce criticism on social media. AP noted many of the responses argued "facial hair is a personal choice and that people shouldnâ€™t be judged on their appearance." The Reds talisman has gone from strength to strength since returning to the Premier League last summer, but one thing that hasn't changed about the forward is his choice of facial hair, which he had upon arrival from AS Roma.The report also described Salah as a "huge celebrity" in his native Egypt, suggesting the country's majority-Muslim population doesn't have any issue with his facial hair. Salah is the Premier League's current joint-top scorer alongside Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane on 24 goals apiece </p>

            <h2>After China and the G League, a Confident Brandon Jennings Is Back in the NBA</h2>
            <p>When Brandon Jennings suits up for the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday, it will have been almost a year since he stepped on the floor in an NBA uniform. The basketball world was intrigued when news broke in February that Jennings had signed with the Wisconsin Herd, the Bucks' G League affiliate. He was claimed off waivers after a brief stint in China.</p>
